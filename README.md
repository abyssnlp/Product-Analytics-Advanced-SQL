# Product-Analytics-Advanced-SQL

Advanced SQL queries for product based roles in data science.

The queries and datasets share the same label so they go hand in hand. take note that
some of them might have more than 1 dataset, but even so they'll share the same prefix.

Topics covered in each of the queries: 

1. Difference between last and second last user action for each user
2. Users coming in through mobile, web or both
3. Users converting into power users
4. Amount and cumulative amount spent by user per day
5. Average and Median transactions by the user on signup date
6. For every country, the first and last user who signed up

All queries make heavy use of CTEs and window functions to make the solution modular 
and reusable in different scenarios.
